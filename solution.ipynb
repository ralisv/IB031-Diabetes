    "- The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that collects data from U.S. residents on their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services\n",
    "- The dataset has been established in 1984 with 15 states, it now collects data from all 50 states, D.C., and 3 U.S. territories\n",
    "- Over 400,000 adult interviews are completed each year, making it the largest continuous health survey system in the world\n",
    "- Factors assessed include tobacco use, healthcare coverage, HIV/AIDS knowledge/prevention, physical activity, and fruit/vegetable consumption\n",
    "- A record in the data corresponds to a single respondent (each from a single household)\n",
    "- The description of columns can be found in the linked PDF file"
