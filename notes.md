# Findings
    1. Dataset issues
        - Categorical data
            -> weirdly encoded - Health 
            -> where none is enough, no/refused ... instead
        - Duplicate rows
        - Need to handle None values (so far we ignore)
    2. Models considered
        - Random forest - Vojta
        - KNN - Vojta
        - Perceptron - Veronika
        - SVM - Adam 
    3. Evaluation
        - Recall
            - It is better to have true positives and check later medically
